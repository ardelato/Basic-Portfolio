        I am a highly motivated and curious individual who follows the
        philosophy of Kaizen, I aim to constantly improve and learn. Whether it
        is hard technical skills, or soft skills, I love learning new things and
        applying them effectively.

        I recently graduated<i>-Fall 2019-</i>from Cal Poly SLO with a BS in
        Liberal Arts and Engineering
        <a href="https://laes.calpoly.edu/about" target="_blank">(LAES)</a>.
        LAES is an interdisciplinary major combining an engineering
        concentration with a liberal arts concentration. Therefore, I combined
        Computer Science with Psychology to focus user-centered interfaces and
        design. Now I am learning more about web development so I can become a
        full-time Web Developer.

        or I am training as Muay Thai practioner/fighter and hope to one day
        fight in the Rajadamnern Boxing Stadium, Thailand.
